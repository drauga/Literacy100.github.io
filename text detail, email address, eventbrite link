ABOUT LITERACY100
Literacy100 was founded in 2019 by a group of literacy practitioners working in homelessness organisations. There is a growing evidence base to suggest that many homeless people have poor reading and writing skills, yet provision to address this within the sector is piecemeal and often reliant on untrained volunteers. Literacy100 recognises the barriers to education faced by those who have experienced homelessness. Its aims are to share good practice in the delivery of literacy support, and to promote greater access to these services in the homeless and associated sectors.
